# Lab Analyzing Assembly

This lab seeks to help you understand File I/O in c, along with seeing the basic assembly that is generated for programs before it goes into a binary form.

üëâüèΩ **Your Task** will be to write a small C program, that reads an assembly file, and prints out the number of instructions in that file and estimated  cycle count to run the program. 

For example, assume  assembly.s has the following code:
```
MOVQ a, %rax
MOVQ b, %rbx
ADDQ %rbx, %rax
IMULQ %rbx
MOVQ %rax, c
```

Running your program `> estimator.out assembly.s` would print the following to the screen.

```
ADD 1
MOV 3
MUL 1

Total Instructions = 5
Total Cycles = 7
```
MUL, IMULQ are the same thing, along with MOVQ and MOV, etc. 

Let's get started! 

## Paired Programming
Make sure to partner up (or group up). One person should be coding, while the other person is directing. Make sure to ask each other questions, along with the TAs as you work. 

After you determine the 'driver', have them clone this repo to their own computer. 

## Generating Assembly Files (10 Minutes)

Both gcc and clang allow you to generate the assembly file for their code.  Looking at [simple.c], we see a program that
simply adds two numbers, and then ends. However, [simple.s] is the assembly built from this program. This was done using the following option.

> clang -S simple.c

üëâüèΩ **Your Task** Write a **simple** c program, and generate the assembly file.

To help you better understand, you should write a simple/small C program. After you have completed the program, run the compiler with the `-S` option, to see the assembly generated. 

### Discussion
* What are some of the assembly commands generated? 
* Was there more than you expected? 
* Can you find the functions you wrote easily?

## Writing Estimator

Go ahead and use [estimator.c] for your template. We will slow work through building the estimator. 

### Program Arguments (5 minutes)

For the program to work, you will want to handle a single program argument. In C, the program arguments are passed in as parameters to your main function. For example, the following program will print out every program argument.

```c
// Compile with: gcc -g -Wall args.c -o args.out
// Try running with:
//          - ./args.out
//          - ./args.out somefile.c
//          - ./args.out argv1 argv2
#include <stdio.h>

// The parameters to the main function are read in
// when you execute your program on the terminal.
// argc: is the argument count
// argv: is a 'variable' number of arguments provided
//
// This program shows how to iterate through all of the arguments
int main(int argc, char** argv){

    printf("argc is the argument count: %d\n",argc);

    // This loop will print out all of the arguments
    for(int i=0; i < argc; i++){
        printf("argv[%d] is %s\n",i,argv[i]);
    }

    // Then you can use the argv's as needed.
    // example: If argv[1] is suppose to be a particular (like the filename), 
    //          you can make use of it.
    //         So your next step would be to use FILE* input = fopen(argv[1],"r");
    //        Then read every line in that file, and 'parse' the first few characters

    return 0;
}
```

üëâüèΩ **Your Task**  Go ahead and add reading the first program argument (if it exists to estimator)

#### Discussion
* Why would c need to values for program arguments? 

### Reading The File (15 minutes)
If you followed Mike Shaw's video, you will have a good idea of how to read a file. This follows a similar guideline. 

üëâüèΩ **Your Task**  Read the file passed in via program arguments, and print out its contents to the screen 

The standard c library stdlib provides a number of File access functions.  If you wanted to open a file using the first 
program argument, you could do it the following way

```c
FILE *input = fopen(argv[1],"r");
```

Now if you wanted to read a line of the file, you would use the following

```c
char buff[BUFF_SIZE];  // notice BUFF_SIZE is just a number declared at the top
int r;

r = fscanf(input, "%s", buff);
```

The above says read the line from input and store it into the buff. If you are at the end of the file, r will equal `EOF`.

As such, to loop through a file, we can use the following:

```c
char buff[BUFF_SIZE];  // notice BUFF_SIZE is just a number declared at the top
int r;


FILE *input = fopen(argv[1],"r");
r = fscanf(input, "%s", buff);

while (r != EOF) {
   r = fscanf(input, "%s", buff);  // grab the next line and store into buff
}
close(input); // don't forget to close a file!
```

Using the outline above, add to your estimator.c to print out the contents of the file based on the file name passed into args. This is always a good task to accomplish before working on files. Can you simply dump the contents to the screen! 

### Now The Estimator (60 minutes)

You can read the file! That is half the battle. Now we are ready to define the estimator specifications. 

* Your program should output counts for ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, MOV, LEA, PUSH, POP, and RET. 
* Your program should figure out the cycles for each command. You can use the following chart to match cycles on a per command basis
  * ADD counts as 1 cycle
  * SUB counts as 1 cycle
  * MUL counts as 3 cycles
  * DIV counts as 24 cycles
  * MOV counts as 1 cycle
  * LEA counts as 3 cycles
  * PUSH counts as 1 cycle
  * POP counts as 1 cycle
  * RET counts as 1 cycle
  * For example, is MUL shows up twice, it will say MUL 2 and then later 6 cycles (2 * 3)
* For the sake of simplicity, your tools should treat all instructions of the same type as equivalent using the same cycle count for all of the different forms. For instance, ADD would include ADDQ, ADDB, ADDL, etc. and count them all as 1 cycle.
IMUL is equivalent to MUL, IDIV is equivalent to DIV.
* You may ignore other assembly instructions (i.e. incq, decq) that are not in the above list.

### Implementation Hints
* This will involve counters for each command (or an array, but keep it simple / easy at first!) 
* It will require a very large if/else statement. 
* Your `if/else if`  will also need to consider or, for example "MOV" or "mov" is valid for mov. 
* `strstr()` helps you find the 'needle in the haystack' of two strings. You will want to use this!
* First only make your estimator work with a single command (add for example), then work on other commands. 
* Loop through the file counting first. Then worry about printing at the end. 

As always remember to implement incrementally. 

#### Discussion
* What were some challenges?
* What do the cycles tell you about the difficulty of the process for the computer?
* Why does this matter?
  * This right here is the hard one. It can be difficult to see the forest through the trees, so discuss some reasons that come to mind and share them with the class at the end. 
* If you have time, use the Godbolt tool (linked below) to try equivalent programs in various languages. 
  * How does python and c differ, even if it the code is "equivalent"?
